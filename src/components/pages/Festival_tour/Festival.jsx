          India is a land of various religions and cultures, which teach us to live in harmony with everyone. Every festival celebrates brotherhood. Every religion has its own culture and religious beliefs. Celebrating festivals together with family and friends is a moment of joy and happiness.
          Festivals are larger than life celebrations of various things. They occur at regular intervals and helping in breaking the monotony of life. Furthermore, they give you the chance to celebrate the little and big things in life. Festivals are the carriers of peace and joy in the communities.

        <p> 
        India is known for its rich cultural heritage. It is a diverse country with people of various religions and various cultural beliefs. People of different religions practise different cultures and traditions. Every event is dedicated to the celebration of brotherhood. Every religion has its own religious beliefs and customs.<br/>
         Celebrating festivals with family and friends is a joyous occasion that brings us all closer together. We forget about the hatred and enmity and just remember the love and respect we have for one other. Every year, India celebrates over thirty festivals to spread love and pleasure.<br/>
          Before every festival, people start their preparations a few days earlier. They go shopping, buy new dresses, various ingredients for making various food items, etc.<br/>
           In various cultures, people draw rangolis, decorate their houses with flowers and also whitewash their houses to bring peace and positivity. We celebrate Onam, Pongal, Holi, Dussehra, Rath Yatra, Christmas, Eid, Guru Nanak Jayanti, Gandhi Jayanti, Independence Day, Republic Day, and other national and religious festivals throughout the year.<br/>
            Every holiday is enthusiastically celebrated in accordance with its culture and religious beliefs. The celebration of these festivals demonstrates the solidarity of the people. Our forebears’ achievements, as well as the triumph of virtue over evil, are commemorated in these ceremonies. Festivals elicit a great deal of excitement and anticipation among children.<br/>
             To commemorate the festivities, people share a variety of dishes and don new outfits. National festivals are observed by all citizens of the country, regardless of religion or caste. These are commemorated to honour the country’s heroes and to pay tribute to the nation.<br/>
