// <h3>Pakora</h3>
// <p>It's hard not to love crispy deep-fried snacks, which is probably why pakoras are a popular favorite across India. Also known as bhaja, bhajia, and bhonda, these terms encompass a category of food with a similar preparation: Sliced vegetables are coated in a chickpea flour batter and fried until golden. Although vegetables like onions, potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, and spinach are traditionally used as the bulk of the snack, modern recipes swap them out for chicken and fish too. Pakoras can vary in size, but they're typically just the right amount to be served as an afternoon bite with a cup of chai.</p>
